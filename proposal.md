## Description

We’re building a fun, interactive typing speed test using Python and Tkinter. The program shows random sentences for users to type, tracks how fast and accurately they type, and gives feedback like WPM, time, and mistakes when the test ends. It’s basically a mini desktop version of typingtest.com made by ourselves!

## Inspirations Behind

We wanted something both practical and fun to build. Typing tests are simple, but they involve real-time input, timers, accuracy checking, and interface design. These are all things that make it a great small project to practice Python GUI programming.
